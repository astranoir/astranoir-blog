It was 75F today, so Kes and I went down to Dickson for some food, and walked around for a bit.  Because _Predators_ is coming out this year, Kes wanted me to watch _Predator_ (since I'd never seen it before), so I watched that this evening.  It wasn't too bad.  I can definitely see how a lot of people would love it.  Not really my thing, though.  I don't mind going to see _Predators_ in theatres with everyone, but it's not a movie about which I'm super-excited. Tomorrow I'm headed to my parents' because my dad got a teaching award!  He's going to make a presentation Thursday, so I will be present for that and the luncheon.  It will be nice to see family for a little bit. I got invited to a friend's Passover Seder.  Hopefully I can go.  I have gotten a lot out of the past two times I attended a Seder with her.  I'm just worried about being a little tired since it will be Saturday evening, and is out of town a bit.  We might also go see _Clash of the Titans_ Easter afternoon, so it sounds like I will have a full weekend.
