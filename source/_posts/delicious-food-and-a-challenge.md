**Delicious Food Kes decided he would make bao today, and has been working very hard on it since I got home from work.  I stopped by Harps to pick up some garlic and cabbage for the filling, and thought I'd pick up some spring rolls to go with our meal.  There were instructions for baking the spring rolls in addition to frying, so I tried the baking route this time.** [![IMG_0270](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4040/4439670032_34c6414e99_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bubem/4439670032/ "IMG_0270 by ater_unda, on Flickr") [![IMG_0262](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4011/4439664208_902dee72fd_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bubem/4439664208/ "IMG_0262 by ater_unda, on Flickr") **A Challenge Disappointed that my previous post did not refer to [Thomas Hobbes'](http://librivox.org/leviathan-books-i-and-ii-by-thomas-hobbes/) _[Leviathan](http://librivox.org/leviathan-books-i-and-ii-by-thomas-hobbes/)_, my friend Tanner challenged me to listen to the audiobook and write a review of this work.  I've read excerpts for philosophy classes, but have not consumed the work as a whole before.  This will be very different for me to judge as an audiobook since [LibriVox](http://librivox.org/)'s audiobooks are all read by volunteers, not professionals.**
