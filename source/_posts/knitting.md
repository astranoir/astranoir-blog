Not much out of the norm today.  I had a busy day at work.  Then, on my way home, I dropped the Kindle cover off at the post office (wow, their parking lot is WAY too small).  Kes and I grabbed some groceries, then headed back to my place to watch last night's episode of _Castle_ on Hulu.  We also caught up on _Caprica_, though I still have mixed feelings about that show.  While watching the latest episode, I showed Kes how to knit.  We haven't gotten to how to purl or bind off yet, but he can cast on and knit decently.  He has some frustrations with dropping/adding stitches, but that seems to be the norm with learning how to knit. He seemed to pick it up quickly in general, so I'm sure that if he continues to have interest in knitting, he'll improve quickly. Since then, I've mostly been relaxing while watching Kes play Mass Effect 2, and working on my new knitting project.  My plan is to knit panels, then stitch them together into a quilt-like blanket.  I'm just doing a basic stocking net.  I'd rather go simple and actually finish a big project like a blanket than do one or two really intricate panels and burn out.

The one panel I've finished is mostly hidden by the scissors and balls of yarn, but I had set the knitting down on the table, and thought it would be a cute snapshot of what I've been up to lately.  I'm still only to about page 71 in  _Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell_, so nothing to update on my opinion of the book. By the way, for anyone with extra jeans they aren't donating to a community group, and/or who shops at the GAP, I caught an [article at Treehugger](http://www.treehugger.com/files/2010/03/recycle-old-jeans-into-insulation-this-weekend-at-the-gap.php?campaign=th_rss) about the GAP taking up jeans for recycling now through March 14.  They will make them into insulation.  If you don't care about reducing waste and recycling, or about making insulation to donate to needy communities, you may still be interested in this initiative because people who donate their old denim get a discount on new GAP jeans.
