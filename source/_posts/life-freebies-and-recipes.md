My pepper plant finally started flowering instead of just budding!  (Click for larger picture)

**Voting** Today was primary day, so I voted before going out and about town. **Barnes and Noble Freebies** After voting, I went to Barnes and Noble because I heard I could get a free ebook (in addition to the weekly free ebook in the Nook store).  When I connected to the B&N wi-fi, I got a coupon for a free 7-layer brownie thing from the cafe, so I picked one of those up first.  Then I searched through the store, trying to find my free book.  I was unable to find it, and eventually wandered out of the store.  Of course, upon leaving, I saw a sign telling me to ask an associate to show me how to get their ebook reader application to get a code for a free book.  I went back in, and did just that.  From what I can tell, **anyone** can go in to ask for a code for this week's free ebook (whether they have a Nook or not).  This week's ebook is _The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency_ by Alexander McCall Smith. **Cooking Presentation and Recipes** Finally, I attended our health center's Spirit of Women program for this month:  Cooking the "Right" Way.  Employees of the local co-op came to give us information on healthy food, and their cook gave a presentation on healthy spring/summer recipes.  He gave me permission to post the recipes here (see end of post), but please note that I edited for clarity and comments.  Overall, I enjoyed the presentation.  We were able to try each dish, so along with the recipes, I'll post some of my thoughts on them. **Arugula Acai Salad** (This was my least favorite recipe, but it seemed like in the hubbub the vinaigrette was not properly mixed, and I did not get the sweeter aspect of the dish.) Ingredients: 1 cup arugula 0.5 oz. goat cheese 2 Tbsp almonds (sliced) Acai Vinaigrette - 1/4 cup olive oil - 1/8 cup acai juice - 1/4 red onion (diced) - 1 tsp garlic powder - 1 tsp ground coriander - 1 tsp ground ginger puree vinaigrette ingredients until smooth; toss with other salad ingredients Feel free to add other tidbits such as dried cranberries, raisins, or carrots (For me, the almonds were critical for the salad tasting okay.  I didn't get any of the goat cheese, though, and I find arugula to be very bitter) **Avocado Cucumber Soup** (This was my favorite recipe.  I love avocado.  I rarely have cold soups, but I could even see someone using this as a really light guacamole-type dip.) Ingredients: 1 avocado 1 **peeled cucumber 1 seeded and peeled roma tomato 1 red onion diced small 1 tsp lime juice** Chop cucumber and blend into a food processor (**it will not blend well if left unpeeled).  If you wish to drain, drain through a cheesecloth or mesh colander.  Mix remaining ingredients into the blender or food processor (after peeling and pitting the avocado).  Serve chilled. Optional:** top with leftover onion and tomato, diced. **Quinoa Salad** (This pleasantly surprised me.  I enjoyed it a lot.  It reminded me of fried rice.) One note we were given regarding quinoa:  if you choose to grow it yourself, the leaves can also be edible. Ingredients: 1 cup quinoa (soak 15 minutes after measuring) "water broth" - 3/4 cup water + 3/4 cip vegetable or chicken stock (note: a basic recipe for homemade vegetable stock given during the presentation is 1 gallon of water to 1 lb of a mix of carrots, celery, and onion, boiled for about 30 min) 1 clove garlic **minced** 1/2 yellow onion **diced small** 1/2 cup carrots **peeled and diced small 1/2 bunch green onion diced 3 Tbsp dried cranberries** Soak the quinoa with enough cold water to cover.  Strain the water off the quinoa.  Add quinoa and water broth to a pot and bring to a boil, cover with a tight fitting lid, and simmer for 15 minutes.  Saute the onion until caramelized.  Stir cooked quinoa and the rest of the vegetables together with a fork to fluff.  Can be served hot or cold.
