This (Saturday) morning I automatically woke up at 6AM, and we hit the road by about 8AM.  It is now 1:18 AM, Sunday.  Unfortunately, this long day meant I had great difficulty staying awake in the dark theatre during the opera at 8 this evening.  What I was conscious for, I really enjoyed.  When else am I going to see choreography from a Lady Gaga music video implemented in an opera? I still feel guilty because I really wanted to fully experience the show.  I won't be able to watch the whole thing because even though we planned on going to tomorrow's matinee, it is an hour later than we expected.  That crossed the line for being too late for us to get home at a reasonable time, so we will be heading out before the show instead.  On the plus side, I got to spend a lot more time with my sister than I often do when we visit.  We were never close while growing up, but I'm enjoying learning about the person into whom she's grown.  It turns out she's pretty cool.
