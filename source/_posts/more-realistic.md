It's probably going to be more realistic for me to aim for two blog posts a week.  I'm still getting a feel for what works for me.  I'm also probably going to be messing around with the layout still/again as well. Update on my life: Kes and I went to Lennie's Sub Shop for hot sandwiches on Saturday, then went to see _Kickass_.  While I personally enjoyed the movie a lot, I have reservations about recommending it across the board.  It's pretty violent, and has possibly offensive language (uttered by children for the most part), and so is definitely not a movie for everyone.  However, it's definitely adrenaline-pumping if you like over-the-top action.  There are also a lot of comic book references that add \[even more\] humor to the movie.  I was most apprehensive about Nicholas Cage's performance, but I think he did a good job.  I will agree with most of the reviews I've seen and say Hit Girl was a much more interest/exciting/memorable than Kickass himself.  For me, the draw was a mix between her impressive fighting skills, and a morbid fascination with a child using such vulgar language and ridiculous violence. I know I keep saying it, but I am working on some creative writing to post.  The plan is to complete a short scene from the library in the repurposed missile silo story.  On its completion I will decide if I want to keep toying around with ideas for that story, or if I want to work on something else.
