**Reading I've gotten a little further in _Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell_ The book almost feels like it has started.  I'm pretty sure I'm about to meet the second titular character.** **Knitting Slow, but steady progress in knitting, I suppose.  Four panels instead of just three.** **Movies I watched all of _The Blues Brothers_ for the first time today.  I loved it!  I commented to Kes that their concert reminded me of _The Sound of Music._ They let them finish their show before taking them into custody, but it's not Nazis this time.  Then I realized there were Nazis after them in _The Blues Brothers_.  Amusing, but not a big correlation between the two movies.** **Gaming For the past month or so I haven't been playing many video games.  I'm getting back in the groove, though.  Yesterday, I played some _Civ IV_.  It seems like it could be an enjoyable game, but I'm pretty bad at it, and don't really understand the intricacies of gameplay.  Today I replayed the end of  _Mass Effect_ so I finally had a save file to import into _Mass Effect 2_.  Playing through the first part of _Mass Effect 2_ with the "cannon" story was awful for me because my character was not a terrible person, whereas apparently cannon Commander Shepard is.  I hated going around places and people hating on me for letting certain people die, or people who were supposed to be dead coming up to me and complaining at me.  Ugh.  Now I feel like I can experience the game properly.** **Internet My internet was out for a large chunk of today, yikes!  Honestly, it didn't affect me too much.  It was mostly out while I showered, had lunch, watched _The Blues Brothers_, and knitted.  I was a little worried it wouldn't be up in time for me to make a blog entry, but here it is!**
