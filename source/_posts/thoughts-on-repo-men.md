Overall, I would recommend against watching _Repo Men,_ or at least wait to rent on dvd/bluray.  While the acting was reasonable, the overall story was poor, in my opinion.  It was sluggish in too many places, and was bizarre in unenjoyable ways.  It definitely had one of the most bizarre sex scenes I've seen.  The ending also felt pretty weak.  I wouldn't agree with some reviews I've read that the movie tried to be too deep and was heavy-handed with its message.  It felt more like an action sci-fi movie that lost its way somehow.  The action scenes weren't too bad, if a bit gory.  It seemed like it could have been a reasonably fun movie, but fell short.
