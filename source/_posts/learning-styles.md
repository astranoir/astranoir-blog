**Sharing** I recently shared an article about [The Learning Pyramid](http://stephenslighthouse.com/2010/02/26/the-learning-pyramid/) through Google Buzz.  Based on the interest in the article, I thought some people might be interested in [filling out a questionnaire](http://www.vark-learn.com/english/page.asp?p=questionnaire) to figure out how they learn best.  My results showed I was [VARK multimodal](http://www.vark-learn.com/english/page.asp?p=multimodal), which pretty much means I have no specific learning input preference.  From my point of view, I learn best by doing, so I'm a kinesthetic learner. **Crafting** Tim got the Kindle cover I made him in the mail today.  Here's how it looks on his Kindle:

**Edit (forgot to mention): I'm going to the [Steve Martin](http://tickets.waltonartscenter.org/calendar/view.asp?id=4761) concert (**Performing with The Steep Canyon Rangers -** An Evening of Bluegrass & Banjo) on April 24 with Kes and Jason!  We have 3 balcony seats together, and I'm pretty excited.  I can't believe tickets sold out so fast.  I think we got the last 3 together in the balcony when we purchased ours.**
