It seems like I've taken a lengthy break from a few things.  I haven't been writing much (here or for fun), haven't been reading much, and haven't been running.  Hopefully I'll get back in the groove starting today.  I woke up at 5:30 this morning without an alarm and figured that was a sign I should go running.  I haven't been running in a couple weeks, so I didn't want to push myself too hard, but I was able to run about 1.5 miles without stopping to supplement with walking!  Now, I just want to make sure I do that at least 3 times per week. Thanks to the [Colony of Readers](http://www.goodreads.com/group/show/9174.ColonyOfReaders) book club, I have started reading again in the past couple days.  We're reading The Windup Girl, which is a relatively new science fiction novel.  I'll post my thoughts when I've gotten a little further in the book.  I've gotten 5 or 6 chapters in so far.  I will say I disagree with the people who say it's hard to get into.  I find all the food-related stuff to be pretty interesting. I meant to post a mini-review of the movie _Salt_ last Tuesday after Kes and I watched it, but I forgot.  I thought the actors did a good job, but here's my distilled thoughts on the movie:  the tone of the movie did not match the content of the movie, to me.  That dichotomy made it too difficult for me to suspend my disbelief, and kept me from getting immersed in the story.  I think I would have enjoyed it more and been able to suspend my disbelief if it was spun as science fiction as opposed to super-realism.
