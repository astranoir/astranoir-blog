![Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell, and Gateway](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4069/4404422643_1188b81e3a.jpg "Currently Reading 03 March 2010") "Currently reading" may be a bit misleading as a title.  I have not begun reading either book.  I plan on starting to read [Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/259035.Jonathan_Strange_Mr_Norrell_A_Novel) tonight, and my goal is to finish reading both books by the end of the month at the latest. It would be more accurate to say "about to read," but that sounds noncommittal to me. At any rate, I hope to be getting deep into these books as soon as possible. Some might wonder why I am reading two hard copy books.  While I'm continuing to use my nook, Kes is loaning me [Gateway](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1578130.Gateway), and as far as I can tell, [Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/259035.Jonathan_Strange_Mr_Norrell_A_Novel) isn't available as an ebook.  I'm finding it irritatingly common that the books I'm interested in reading are not available digitally.  This may have something to do with my interest in science fiction.  It's my impression that most science fiction writers benefit very little from digital books as compared to writers of other genres, and many of these sci-fi authors are against their use.  Ursula K Le Guin is [notably](http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/feb/23/authors-opt-out-google-book-settlement)against Google Books, for example (not that I feel free online books and pay online books are the same, but digital piracy frightens a lot of people). I am trying a different blog theme.  This is a fixed-width theme as opposed to a flexible-width one.  I would like a flexible-width theme, but I think I prefer the way this one looks otherwise.  Since I've only recently begun the blog, I'm sure its appearance will be in flux for awhile. Thanks for any and all comments, by the way.  They are appreciated. I will conclude with an Esperanto phrase of the day, which I chose from [Lernu](http://en.lernu.net)while learning about useful phrases: Pardonu mi devas foriri. - Pardon, I have to leave.
