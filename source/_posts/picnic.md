It's always nice to be able to relax with Kes on his day off.  My dad suggested Kes and I have a picnic since it was over 70F today.  I thought it was a great idea, and suggested it to Kes, who pointed out that since the snow was still melting, the ground is all wet.  Whoops.  Instead, we had a picnic in my living room while watching _Dr. Who._
