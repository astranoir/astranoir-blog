Unfortunately, I'm already not meeting the goal of a daily post. Update on lunch:  everything kept very well, even the avocados.  No pictures of today's lunch.  I had some Progresso clam chowder and French bread. I used my pressure cooker for the first time today.  I cooked a batch of pinto beans, and am attempting to mash them like I've been shown in the past, but am not having much luck with the mashing part.  The cooking part was a lot less scary than I expected.  Kes did his best to find the safest pressure cooker he could, and it seems pretty good so far. For dinner, I made chicken curry.  I just used an S&B medium hot curry brick, carrots, peas, potatoes, chicken and water.  Not too complex, but I like the taste. Reading-wise, I'm a few chapters into the first _Dresden Files_ book.  I've read this far before, but never got to finish it.  I've always liked mystery books, and adding a dash of the supernatural is definitely appealing.  I think some of it is a little overly silly (did he really have to name it the "Nevernever?"), but on the whole, I'm enjoying it so far. Since I didn't get to finish re-listening to _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_ on CD on the drive to and from my parents' house, I've been listening to it off and on.  I had forgotten how depressing it is.  I also discovered that JK Rowling is fundamentally against publishing her works as ebooks when I went looking for a written copy for my Nook. It sounds like Rowling's dislike of ebooks is a mix between her love of the physically written word (apparently she wrote all the _Harry Potter_ books in **longhand**), and her fear of pirates.  Regarding the latter, I would have to say I agree with a lot of people that if you deprive the market of a legal version of something it's clamoring for, the demand isn't going to disappear, and her decision has likely driven more people to piracy than if she had just allowed ebooks of her works to be released.  Regarding her reverence of the physically written word, I think that's pretty cool.  I remember seeing pictures of her handwritten copy of _The Tales of Beedle the Bard_.  I do think it's a little short-sighted not to publish ebook versions of her work nonetheless.  After all, there are audiobook versions of her work, and that's certainly not handwritten (yes, I know reading aloud, different medium, etc.).  Anyway, I would like for there to be \[legal\] ebook versions of Rowling's books.
