I've been feeling uncreative and unproductive lately.  A lot of times I will watch television, read, or play games when I come home.  I'd prefer to also **make** things/create something.  I didn't end up completing the [creativity boot camp](http://creativebootcamp.blogspot.com/) [I mentioned previously](http://astranoir.com/?p=227).  This weekend, I discovered [hitRECord](http://www.hitrecord.org), and felt even guiltier about my lack of creativity.  Fortunately, I've been able to use it to push myself to learn new things, and create new things. I worked through my Java book for an hour this evening.  I didn't get through the first chapter, but I'm hoping that working through at this pace, and handwriting everything will help me learn it better.  I then completed days 1 and 2 of the creativity boot camp challenges.  I decided to [post the results to hitRECord](http://www.hitrecord.org/users/astranoir) because I like the site so much, and because I feel like it's good to do reasonable things that are slightly outside of my comfort zone (I definitely fear people judging me).
