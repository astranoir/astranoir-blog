Last weekend I made lumpia. Lumpia is a deep-fried Filipino spring roll. I got ideas from what my Lolo (my mom's dad) taught me, as well as from a book my Auntie Tellie and Uncle Al got me called _The Little Lumpia Book_ by Gene Gonzalez. Sunday, I spent about 5 hours chopping vegetables. I decided to include onion, carrot, cabbage, potato, water chestnut, bamboo shoot, green bean, bean sprout, celery and garlic. I made nearly 2 batches worth of lumpia (about 175 lumpia altogether). [![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2200/5728419749_21b8d84c56_m.jpg "Onion")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bubem/5728419749/in/photostream)[![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2229/5728972232_8d1c7ac905_m.jpg "Onion and Carrot")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bubem/5728972232/in/photostream) I only used a little over half an onion for all 2 batches. I think I matchsticked 5 medium-sized carrots.

[![](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5146/5728424433_258bd4b681_m.jpg "Waterchestnut")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bubem/5728424433/)[![](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5307/5728425877_9940080670_m.jpg "Bamboo Shoot")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bubem/5728425877/) I used 1 can of water chestnuts, and about half a can of bamboo shoots (I'm not the biggest fan of canned bamboo shoots). I included around half a pound of thinly sliced green beans (about 1cm thick, in discs the width of the bean), but only 1 stalk of celery. I added generous amounts of minced garlic before cooking. For some horrible reason, I couldn't find fresh bean sprouts at the store. I had a can of them, but was skeptical about how canned bean sprouts would work. I drained them, and let them air dry for about a day. Cooked in with everything else, they weren't too bad. I'd definitely recommend fresh bean sprouts, though! Since I was cooking to share with my food club friends, I made these lumpia vegetarian-friendly. With the first batch I used ground [Quorn](http://www.quorn.us/Home/) as the protein (6 oz. or half a bag). I stir fried with the vegetables about a tablespoon of sesame seed oil; and salt, pepper and soy sauce to taste until the vegetables were tender, but still crisp. I cooked the second batch the same way, using chopped pre-cooked shrimp instead of Quorn. I took Monday off work (finishing off my vacation hours before they expired on my 2 year anniversary with the company)! [Marisa](http://takentogether.tumblr.com/) helped me wrap lumpia for 3 hours before they were ready for freezing and frying. We bought frozen spring roll wrappers from a local Asian market. I thawed them by keeping them in the refrigerator for 24 hours, then setting them out on the counter in the morning. Below are the steps we followed for filling and wrapping lumpia: [![](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5190/5728406841_d618fc930e_m.jpg "Wrapping Lumpia Step 1")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bubem/5728406841/in/photostream)[![](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5210/5728407365_7b75a33383_m.jpg "Wrapping Lumpia Step 2")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bubem/5728407365/in/photostream) First, lay a single wrapper flat. Then fill with about 2 teaspoons of filling, spreading lengthwise. [![](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3569/5728407629_14d9201ea4_m.jpg "Wrapping Lumpia Step 3")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bubem/5728407629/in/photostream)[![](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5125/5728958440_8a1224c609_m.jpg "Wrapping Lumpia Step 4")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bubem/5728958440/in/photostream) Fold the bottom up about 1/3 of the way. Tuck some of the excess around the filling.

[![](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5104/5728408687_d6cd458243_m.jpg "Wrapping Lumpia Step 7")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bubem/5728408687/in/photostream)[![](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5265/5728960170_05bf8088fb_m.jpg "Wrapping Lumpia Step 8")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bubem/5728960170/in/photostream) Roll up once, then apply adhesive (we used water mixed with cornstarch, but you can use egg, or even plain water) to the top edges of the wrapper.

[![](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3655/5728410957_2f0fafcc91.jpg "175 Wrapped Lumpia")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bubem/5728410957/in/photostream) The 2 of us wrapped 175 lumpia in around 3 hours. We bagged 125 of them for freezing.

I fried the lumpia in canola oil using my kawali (Filipino wok) over medium-high electric heat.
