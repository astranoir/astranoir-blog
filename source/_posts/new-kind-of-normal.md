Now that I've moved, life is starting to settle into a new kind of normal.  Not radically new, but something to get used to. I got a new washer and dryer, which are fantastic.  I'm sure the novelty of using them will wear off, but for the moment, they're my new gadgets, and I'm enjoying them a lot. My tomato plant was pretty much dead even before I moved, so I gave it to my friend to see if she can resurrect it.  My bell pepper plant seems to be doing quite well, though.  One of the peppers is even starting to turn red! I've even been starting to cook again (this tortellini and broccoli salad was for work).  While I'm being extra cleanly and careful in the kitchen in case there's still a mouse, I'm hoping the mouse is gone.  Regarding the tortellini and broccoli salad, if it sounds appealing to anyone, and you would like the recipe, let me know and I'll post it up here. I'm starting to exercise again as well, now that I'm not stressing about moving, so hopefully that will be quickly integrated into my new normal!
