I keep thinking there is only one mouse that has somehow gotten trapped in the duplex.  If that is true, the mouse problems maybe eradicated.  Jason caught a mouse in a bag of food he hadn't unpacked yet, and quickly threw the whole thing away outside (not sure where he put the trashcan, though; hopefully not near the building).  I'm hoping that  I won't have to worry about the mouse/mice anymore.  It makes cooking and working in the kitchen more stressful than it needs to be.
