I always babble about the weather like a person who doesn't know how to carry on a conversation.  Whew.  It got up to 86F today.  It was so beautiful and sunny outside, and I was stuck in my car.  Not stuck as in locked in, of course; stuck as in needing to drive the 4.5 hours back home. When I was younger, I had a dream in which I got stuck in a car.  I was at the mall with my family, and had gotten into our minivan.  The doors all shut themselves, and I couldn't get out of any door.  The car started driving of its own accord, and I couldn't wrestle the steering wheel away from this invisible force.  The dream ended with me in the back of the van, staring out of the rear windshield as my family faded into the distance.

It was great being able to see my dad's presentation, and seeing him receive his award.  He did a wonderful job.  It was nice being able to see people who attended.  I don't make it out to my parents' very often, and I rarely see people I know from the area, so I really enjoyed the opportunity to say 'hi.' I didn't really think ahead to take Friday off in addition to Thursday so I could stay with my parents through Easter.  I'm a little disappointed, but I am glad that I will have great things to do this weekend with friends. I would like to bask in the sun now that I'm not confined to my car over the course of the weekend.  Too bad it's going to rain.
