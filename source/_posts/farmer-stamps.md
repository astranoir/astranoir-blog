A coworker friend of mine named Thomas has a large garden, and has been working on canning some of what he's grown! He was kind enough to share homemade salsa, canned jalapeños, and jalapeño peach jelly. I believe everything was grown in his garden except the peaches.

I've been having it on whole wheat bread with neufchâtel.
