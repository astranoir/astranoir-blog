[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bubem/5757934717/)I found my dinosaur sandwich cutter, which I'd never used. I decided to try it out yesterday on my peanut butter and jelly "sandwich" tortillas. Before work, I made the pbj tortillas, then cut them with the sandwich cutter. ![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2256/5757934717_5e3fe73b3e.jpg "Dino pbj tortillas - cutting") It may have been because I was cutting through a tortilla instead of sandwich bread, but I had difficulty getting it to cut through completely. I had to hold up the tortilla and press along the edges on the bottom to get it to cut cleanly.

I took the leftover "crust" pieces, and ate those for breakfast.

The raspberry preserves had gotten a little runny, but it didn't seem to affect the integrity of the dinosaur-shaped sandwiches.

I tried to find them online, but they only had the dolphin one. I think there is also a pink heart one available. The one online is $7, but I'm pretty sure I bought mine for less than $5. _All pictures for this post were taken with my Samsung Galaxy S Captivate, using the_ [_Vignette_](http://neilandtheresa.co.uk/Android/Vignette/) _App._
