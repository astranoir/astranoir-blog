[![](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4147/5042989235_49d9c2534a_m.jpg "Half Peck of Arkansas Black Apples")](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4147/5042989235_49d9c2534a_m.jpg)I attended the Arkansas Apple Festival today.  I shared in a delicious apple dumpling with ice cream, and purchased a half peck of Arkansas black apples.  I didn't really get to look around at any of the craft booths because we arrived a little late (considering they close down all the stalls at 5pm). After the festival, I got some delicious sushi at Meiji, wandered around the mall a bit, then watched _Kamikaze Girls_ with friends.  Even though it's only Friday night, I oddly feel as though my weekend is drawing to a close.  What an odd sensation.
