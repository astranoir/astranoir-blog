Don't forget that today is [Free Comic Book Day](http://www.freecomicbookday.com/)!  If I'm able to pick anything up, I'll post what I got.  The first year I went, I really wanted _Flight_.  Last year I was most excited about the _Blackest Night_ (issue 0 or whatever it was).  This year I don't know if I'm really looking forward to anything.   Too bad none of the places around here ever get the free Heroclix.  [War Machine looks cool this year](http://www.freecomicbookday.com/comic_war-machine.asp). Happy May Day/Beltane as well!  Here's the view from my balcony this morning: [![](http://www.flexamail.com/GetImage.ashx?id=3210 "May Day Sunrise")](http://www.flexamail.com/GetImage.ashx?id=3210)
