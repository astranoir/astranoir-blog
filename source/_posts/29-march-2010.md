Normally I would be spending today with Kes.  It is often his day off.  One of his coworkers got married, and got stuck in the airport, though, so Kes is at work and I'm watching _Torchwood_.  It definitely has a different vibe from _Dr. Who_, but I find it to be enjoyable.  I tried watching some of the earlier _Dr. Who_ iterations (from before it was brought back with Chris Eccleston), but I wasn't as drawn into it.  I enjoyed _The Three Doctors_, for example, but the experience of the show is so different. I might actually go to sleep before the sun sets today.  I've been staying up until it's dark, but that's making me really tired.  Hopefully I can get my schedule straightened out so I will function normally. _Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell_ is still coming slowly, even though relatively interesting things are happening.  I doubt it's possible for me to finish reading that and/or _Gateway_ by the end of the month like I planned, so I may move on to a different book for awhile.  Probably something I have on my Nook. Happy almost Passover (the sun is still up).
