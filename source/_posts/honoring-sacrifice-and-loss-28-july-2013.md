As an advocate for peace, I choose to take the time at least once weekly to remember the cost of war to civilians, and to remember the friends and families of United States service personnel who have been killed. Â  This past week, the Department of Defense announced the following combat-related deaths: 1st Lt. **Jonam Russell**, 25, of Cornville, Arizona Sgt. **Stefan M. Smith**, 24 of Glennville, Georgia Spc. **Rob L. Nichols**, 24, of Colorado Springs, Colorado [Source](http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=16168) _May the friends and families of those who have died find peace. May returned veterans find peace. May the world find peace._
