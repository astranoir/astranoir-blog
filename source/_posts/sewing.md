Much of my day has been occupied wrestling with a sewing project.  I had been working on it by hand, but the frustration led me to try to figure out how to work the sewing machine my mom is letting me use. (http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4049/4418983622_3c11c5ebc9.jpg "my sewing machine") It introduced some different difficulties such as refilling the bobbin, but with Kes' help, I was able to figure out the sewing machine, and finish my project:  a Kindle cover for my friend Tim based off a tutorial from [One Pearl Button](http://www.onepearlbutton.com/2009/10/tutorial-book-style-kindle-cover.html). Here's what it ended up looking like:

Honestly, it's a bit rough, but I definitely enjoyed making something myself, and hopefully Tim enjoys the gift :)
