What would it be like to live in a [re-purposed missile silo](http://www.treehugger.com/files/2010/02/for-sale-atlas-missile-base.php?campaign=th_rss&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+treehuggersite+(Treehugger))? Brainstorming: I like the article author's idea of replacing the house with a bubble/dome Lower levels of silo: catacombs? library archives? I like a giant library How far in the future is this?  No more than 20 years Is there anything growing inside? Hydroponics? --> Is there any reason to go outside How do bathrooms work? Is it a family or community living there? No more than 4 families Did they re-purpose it, or did they get it that way? A constant 55 degrees sounds cold
