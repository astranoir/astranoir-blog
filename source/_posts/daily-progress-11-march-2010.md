Reading [Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/259035.Jonathan_Strange_Mr_Norrell_A_Novel) is coming slowly for me.  I'm on page 99 now, but still don't have much to discuss.  In addition to wanting to avoid spoilers, I don't feel like I've settled into the book yet.  I enjoy the writing style, but I don't feel like I'm getting to know the characters well.  I'm not sure if it's the narrator's point of view, and/or if the author is revealing the characters slowly on purpose.  I am definitely intrigued enough to want to learn more about the characters. Media I watched seasons 1 and 2 of [The Guild](http://www.watchtheguild.com/) on Netflix streaming.  This is the first I've seen of the series.  On Netflix, each season is compiled into a single video, which was really nice for viewing. As blasphemous as some people may find it, I prefer trade paperback compilations of comics to picking up each issue as they come out.  I get irritated enough with books that end each chapter on a cliffhanger, only to switch to another character's point of view for the next chapter.  Overall, I prefer experiencing a whole story at once.  I think this preference extends to [The Guild](http://www.watchtheguild.com/).  That is, I am not sure I could have gotten into the story if I had started watching it when it was coming out, so I'm glad I was able to watch seasons 1 and 2 straight through.

Honestly, it's coming more slowly than I expected. When Ashlyn and I first started knitting in Governor's School, I feel like we finished a whole scarf or hat every day. These panels don't even add up to half a scarf. It's true that I haven't knitted for awhile, so I'm getting back in the groove, but it's also possible that I'm remembering incorrectly.
