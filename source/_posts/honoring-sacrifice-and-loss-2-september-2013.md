As an advocate for peace, I choose to take the time at least once weekly to remember the cost of war to civilians, and to remember the friends and families of United States service personnel who have been killed.   This past week, the Department of Defense announced the following combat-related deaths: Spc. **Kenneth Clifford Alvarez**, 23, of Santa Maria, California Pvt. **Jonathon Michael Dean Hostetter**, 20, of Humphreys, Missouri 1st Lt. **Jason Togi**, 24, of Pago Pago, American Samoa Sgt. 1st Class **Ricardo D. Young**, 34, of Rosston, Arkansas Staff Sgt. **Michael H. Ollis**, 24, of Staten Island, New York Staff Sgt. **Joshua J. Bowden**, 28, of Villa Rica, Georgia

It is also easy to forget that the human cost of war extends beyond combat-related deaths.

_May the friends and families of those who have died find peace. May those in combat areas, as well as their friends and families, find peace. May returned veterans find peace. _May those who experience the mental health costs of war find peace. _May the world find peace._
