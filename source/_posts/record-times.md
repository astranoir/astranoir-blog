I got to hang out with Maggie and Marisa a bit tonight, and took some snapshots of our shenanigans with [Vignette](http://neilandtheresa.co.uk/Android/Vignette/), so I thought I'd share them. They recently got a new-in-box record player off Craigslist. It was playing records too quickly, so we opened it up, determined what was wrong, and fixed it! Also, Bosie hung out in a basket while we listened to Simon and Garfunkel. Fun times.
