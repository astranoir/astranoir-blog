I originally found the idea for Nutella "ice cream" [here](http://www.rumkihn.com/2011/11/nutella-ice-cream.html). I wondered what it would be like if I didn't blend it quite as smoothly as suggested, and just wanted to mess around with it before I make it for others on Friday. The recipe (6 bananas, 1 cup Nutella, blend, freeze) seems so simple that it's hard to believe it will actually work. The original recipe didn't include the weight of bananas used, so hopefully I used ones of comparable size. I decided to blend everything with the paddle attachment for my KitchenAid stand mixer. First I blended the bananas (6 bananas, broken in half): ![](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7154/6784138089_24cd3389a7.jpg "6 bananas")   I used the lowest setting on the mixer to get them to a mashed consistency: ![](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7018/6784143895_6c2766dced.jpg "Mashed bananas")   I added a cup of Nutella: ![](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7012/6784148997_1efafb9fff.jpg "1 cup Nutella") ![](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7023/6784154117_9e60e4ccdc.jpg "Nutella Banana Mix")   I then mixed on low again: ![](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7018/6784162785_fc9c14bbe8.jpg "Banana Nutella Mix")   Finally, I poured the mixture into a freezer-safe container and placed it in the freezer to harden. If the texture is unsatisfactory, I plan to blend the frozen product in the blender.
