I feel like I've been talking about the weather a lot, but it's been occupying my thoughts quite a bit.  Here are some pictures from yesterday.  I decided I wanted cake, so I decided to fill up with gas and drive across the street to the grocery store (yes, I know that driving across the street is kind of terrible, but it's 0.6 miles and pretty dangerous crossing the road in the ice/snow).  I got stuck on my way out of the gas station, but four guys were kind enough to push my car to a place where I could move.

I've had _Skies of Arcadia_ from Gamefly since January, but hadn't played it at all.  Last night, I tried it out for a couple hours.  So far, I'm really enjoying it.  Vyse in _Valkyria Chronicles_ is what sparked my interest in _Skies of Arcadia_ in the first place, and I haven't been disappointed yet.  There isn't a whole lot that sets it apart from other JRPGs for me, but it's a new story (for me), and I've been in the mood for a JRPG-style game.
