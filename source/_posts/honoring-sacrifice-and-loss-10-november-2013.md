As an advocate for peace, I choose to take the time at least once weekly to remember the cost of war to civilians, and to remember the friends and families of United States service personnel who have been killed.   This past week, the Department of Defense announced the following service personnel deaths: Sgt. 1st Class **Forrest W. Robertson**, 35, of Westmoreland, Kansas

It is also easy to forget that the human cost of war extends beyond combat-related deaths. _May the friends and families of those who have died find peace. May those in combat areas, as well as their friends and families, find peace. May returned veterans find peace. _May those who experience the mental health costs of war find peace. _May the world find peace._

The department of defense also operates in non-combat capacities. Currently, the department of defense is [supporting humanitarian relief operations in the Philippines](http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=16362) in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan. _May international cooperation help save lives, and help the world find peace._
