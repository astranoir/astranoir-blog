Yesterday I went to the [Fayetteville Farmers' Market](http://www.fayettevillefarmersmarket.org/). It's only the second or third time I've been this summer, but I definitely want to try to go a few more times. My bank's atm was broken, so I worked on a budget of $7. Here's my haul:

  The tomatoes were so inviting, I immediately made a giant, and delicious, sandwich (whole wheat bread, hickory smoked deli chicken, baby spinach, and fresh tomatoes):
