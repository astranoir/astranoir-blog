Maggie Moos was giving away "free scoops" of "ice cream pizza" for tax day.  I met up there with Jason, and we were both pretty disappointed.  I forgot to take a picture, but the "scoop" would have been pretty tiny to look at.  It was a small piece in a sample cup.  I had been hoping that the ice cream would be in some way similar to pizza (appearance, flavor, something interesting).  However, it just tasted like overly processed ice cream cake to me.  It had a chocolate layer, a vanilla layer, and a red (maybe cherry?) layer, with mini M & M mix-ins.  While I was disappointed, I still think it's cool they wanted to do a special for people on tax day.
