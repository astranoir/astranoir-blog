In preparation for food club tomorrow night, Brandon and Kris came over to help me make a carrot goji cake.  I used [this](http://thegreengirls.com/blog/post/2010/08/Carrot-Goji-Cake-with-Spicy-Icing.aspx) recipe, with a couple tweaks to the frosting (I was only able to get 1 vanilla bean, so we added a dash of vanilla extract, and I used a mix of walnuts and pecans rather than just pecans). When we blended up all the ingredients for the cake, it smelled delicious.  Unfortunately, it didn't look quite as lovely as it smelled.

While we made the cake and frosting, Kes was watching _Demolition Man_ in the background.

Currently, the cake and frosting are setting.  I will plate them for the food party tomorrow evening, and see how people end up liking it!

Brandon was a ton of help.  I would have had problems pitting the dates and dealing with the vanilla bean if he hadn't helped me out.

I'm excited to see what people are bringing tomorrow.  Hopefully the raw food theme isn't too intimidating, and we can all try new things.
