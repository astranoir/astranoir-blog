As was intended, Kes and I picked up some free comics, and we purchased a couple things.  We ended up only stopping by Rock Bottom instead of checking out Hastings and Vintage Stock too.

Kes brought Superman, X-Men and Spiderman to work with him to read on his break.  I read through the rest.  Green Hornet was interesting, but too preview-y for me to get much out of it.  I enjoyed Iron Man the most.

Kes picked up _Chew_ for me as an early birthday present.  I haven't gotten to read through it yet, but I've been in the mood for something mystery-oriented.  I grabbed the lantern corps buttons.  Honestly, I'm not sure what to put them on, but I like having them.

We also picked up a flyer for the Little Rock Comic Con, which we had never heard of before.  Apparently it used to be known as the "comic book cult."  From their [site](http://autobotcitycomics.webs.com/littlerockcomiccon.htm), I'm not sure what to think, especially since their flyer had a picture from the Iron Man 2 movie instead of something from a print comic book.  Only $3 admission, though.

There are probably going to be big changes coming to my blog soon.  I'll try to keep you updated through the upcoming week.
