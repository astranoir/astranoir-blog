On 25 February I [brainstormed](http://astranoir.com/?p=16) about living in a [repurposed missile silo](http://www.treehugger.com/files/2010/02/for-sale-atlas-missile-base.php?campaign=th_rss&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+treehuggersite+(Treehugger)). This is a continuation of that brainstorming process, with a focus on where food would come from if the silo were cut off from any outside contact. Instead of a generic bubble dome on top of to missile silo structure, it seems it would be useful to have a geodesic greenhouse for growing grains and vegetables. Possible crops: wheat tomatoes peppers beans corn potatoes broccoli garlic carrots Making tortillas and other flat breads would probably be more useful than trying to make breads, and even pastas that would need yeast, eggs, etc. that might be difficult to get in a closed system (sans raising chickens for the eggs). It seems as though it would be difficult/impossible to have salt unless it was previously hoarded or unless they somehow had access to salt water.  Having access to salt water from a repurposed missile silo seems unlikely. Growing peppers and spices (which could work easily even in the silo as opposed to the greenhouse) seems like it would be a worthy endeavor regarding seasoning food, especially with an absence of salt. What would be a good way to preserve food other than salting it?  Dehydration seems like one good option; possibly canning in reusable jars as well. Something else to think about:  I think a life in a repurposed missile silo would be most interesting if the silo were secluded.  In what situations would the silo be forcibly secluded, but the greenhouse would still work?  What would it be like if outside life were relatively normal, but a family (or a few families) lived in this silo.  What would kids at school think?  Would the parents work at home as scientists/researchers?
