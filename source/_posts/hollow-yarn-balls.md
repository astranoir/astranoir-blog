Last Saturday, Maggie, Marisa and I decided to make decorative yarn balls based off [this tutorial](http://www.makeandtakes.com/glue-yarn-ball-tutorial). First we chose our yarns and inflated balloons. We used the larger size suggested in the tutorial, as well as smaller water balloons so we could have varied sizes.

The yarn quickly sprung back into place, however, and turned out rather well.
