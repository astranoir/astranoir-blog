Last night Maggie and Marisa came over for dinner and another _Doctor Who_ night. We watched 2 episodes: "New Earth" and "Tooth and Claw." For food, we decided to have salad, quiche, and dessert pastries. Loosely following [this](http://allrecipes.com//Recipe/spinach-quiche/Detail.aspx) recipe*****, we made 4 spinach and mushroom quiches. On a whim, we also made little octopodes from hot dogs (which I only placed on top of the quiches I kept for myself so I wouldn't meat-contaminate the other quiches). I thought I'd share some pictures of our octopus army, and a little hot dogtopus perched atop one of the quiches.

Also, I'm pretty sure we used a lot more cheese than was called for... big surprise. We used fresh spinach and mushrooms \[mini portabellas\], and unsalted butter \[I don't think it indicates which kind of butter to use in the recipe, but unsalted worked just fine, especially since you season it to taste anyway\]. Instead of using seasoned feta, we used plain feta but added extra garlic. Rather than using straight cheddar, we used a shredded blend including cheddar, jack, mozzarella, and other cheeses. In doubling the recipe, we didn't use 2 small onions, but instead used 1 medium white onion.)
