Today's the [25th anniversary of The Goonies](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/06/AR2010060603590.html)! My copy has been missing since I moved to this apartment, so Kes and I picked up another copy from Hastings to watch. I love this movie :) Also, Torchwood (a Doctor Who-related show I mentioned enjoying a lot) is [coming out with a new season soon](http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2010/06/torchwood-barrowman.html), apparently. Â Hopefully Starz will let me stream it on Netflix.
