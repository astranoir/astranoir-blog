Today was nice and sunny outside, and got up to 60F, so I took about an hour long walk while listening to [Hobbes'](http://librivox.org/leviathan-books-i-and-ii-by-thomas-hobbes/) _[Leviathan](http://librivox.org/leviathan-books-i-and-ii-by-thomas-hobbes/)_ on my iPod.  I have to say, it's a lot more difficult to comprehend listening to it versus reading it.  Even when I read something like this, I find myself going back and rereading so I can wrap my head around what the author is trying to express.  It's even more difficult when I'm just listening to it.  I've only gotten to the beginning of chapter 4, and listened to each preceding chapter twice in a row.  I'm not really sure what to think of it.  I've read excerpts before for class, but I'm not recognizing what I'm listening to so far.  It seems like Hobbes is going on and on about physical things like inertia and heat, and either likening them to, or pinpointing them as causes of, senses, dreams, imagination, etc.  It's really very dry.  The volunteer reader is very good, though, especially compared to some of the other readers I've experienced from [Librivox](http://librivox.org).  It's also nice that it seems to be the same reader for every chapter so far.  It's kind of jarring when Librivox has different people read different chapters of a book (though I understand that since all the readers are volunteers and reading an audiobooks is a demanding undertaking, having volunteers only commit to small snippets is logical). I picked up [MC Frontalot's new album](http://frontalot.com/index.php/?page=cd4&sid=705db9b5520ce36b14a37bd00f97dafd) today.  I got to download the mp3s from the site, and my physical CD should arrive sometime in April.  I found out it was coming out because I've been reading more blogs lately, including [Jhonen Vasquez's](http://www.questionsleep.com/mindspill/).  I noticed Jhonen [did the cover art for the album](http://www.questionsleep.com/mindspill/?p=1184), and hopped over to MC Frontalot's page to see when it was coming out.  Since it's available for order now, I decided to pick it up.
