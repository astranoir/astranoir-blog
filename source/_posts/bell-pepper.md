Update on bell pepper plant: I've only had one viable bell pepper.  There were two on the plant at one point, but the plant fell, and one was entirely smashed.  The plant has started recovering nicely, though.  I thought I'd post a picture of the plant, and the bell pepper before I ate the bell pepper :)
