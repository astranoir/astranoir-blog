Kes moved the stationary bike to the living room today.  It has been in the spare bedroom, which made it even more difficult to work up the gumption to use it.  To celebrate, I rode for 20 min while Kes watched _Arrested Development_.  I'm still working on developing/keeping healthy habits, so hopefully having it in the living room will be one more motivation. On the unhealthy side, I nearly always eat processed food for lunch.  One way I'm trying to be healthier is by trying to eat less processed food.  In pursuit of that goal, I have packed both breakfast and lunch for tomorrow (I go to work early enough that it's easiest to eat breakfast at work rather than at home).

Breakfast: Quesadilla: 1 whole grain "soft taco" tortilla, small amount of low fat cheddar cheese, thin spread of pesto, and chopped chicken breast

Lunch: noodle dish:  about 1/3 brick of ramen noodles soaked in water until softened then tossed in about 1/4 teaspoon sesame seed oil, cubed chicken breast, peas, and minced garlic salad:  baby spinach, button mushrooms, with a side of basil parmesan vinaigrette fruit side: avocado (I originally planned on having a clementine orange, but I didn't realize we were out) treat: mangorind candy This is also a test to see if/how much the lunch degrades by the time I eat it tomorrow.
