As an advocate for peace, I choose to take the time at least once weekly to remember the cost of war to civilians, and to remember the friends and families of United States service personnel who have been killed.   This past week, the Department of Defense announced no combat-related deaths.   However, it is easy to forget that the human cost of war extends beyond combat-related deaths.

###### [August 2013 Suicide Information released by the Army](http://www.defense.gov//releases/release.aspx?releaseid=16290)

_May the friends and families of those who have died find peace. May those in combat areas, as well as their friends and families, find peace. May returned veterans find peace. _May those who experience the mental health costs of war find peace. _May the world find peace._
