I found out that my F/friend Peter, from a Quaker Meeting I used to attend, died yesterday morning. I am deeply saddened, and am holding his spirit, and everyone whose life he touched in the Light. A F/friend from that Meeting was kind enough to share an E.E. Cummings poem in honor of Peter's life that really spoke to me.

### i thank You God for most this amazing

#### by E. E. Cummings

i thank You God for most this amazing day: for the leaping greenly spirits of trees and a blue true dream of sky; and for everything which is natural which is infinite which is yes (i who have died am alive again today, and this is the sun's birthday; this is the birth day of life and of love and wings: and of the gay great happening illimitably earth) how should tasting touching hearing seeing breathing any—lifted from the no of all nothing—human merely being doubt unimaginable You?
