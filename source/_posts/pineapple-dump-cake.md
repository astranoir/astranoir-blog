This week's food club theme was actually a challenge: **make a dish to bring that you can create for under $5**. We were given some flexibility: **items that you already have on hand count for $0**. I decided to make a super easy cake recipe that we called "dump" cake growing up. The idea is you take all your ingredients, dump them in a baking dish, bake them, and viola, you have a cake! **Basic Ingredients** 1 box yellow cake mix (you can make your own, but most of the point of this recipe is that it is quick and easy) 1 stick of butter (unsalted) 1 can of fruit Preferably, the fruit should be suspended in syrup. Growing up, we would use canned peaches or pie cherries. I decided to experiment a little and try using canned pineapple suspended in juice. Because the pineapple was suspended in juice rather than syrup, I modified my ingredient list slightly: **My Ingredients** 1 box yellow cake mix 1 stick of butter 1 can of pineapple slices "in its own juice" 2 Tbsp agave nectar

 While you _can_ literally dump everything into a baking dish and bake it, I try to make my ingredients a little more homogeneous, partially so I don't end up with big sections of dry powder. The pineapple juice actually helped with this a lot. I also sliced up the butter and distributed it relatively evenly throughout the dish.

You can see that while I've tried to evenly distribute the ingredients, I haven't bothered to actually mix them together. There is still dry powder, it's just not all in one spot.

**Instructions for baking**

Follow the instructions from the box of cake mix you used (or from the cake mix recipe you used if you made this from scratch). I think I baked mine at around 375F for 30 minutes.

It isn't intended to be a pretty cake, but if you're craving buttery, sugary, cakey goodness, this is a quick way to fulfill that craving!

**Note**: Adding the agave nectar to thicken the juice seemed to work well. I thought I was going to use only half the juice in the can, but I ended up including all of it. I did crush the pineapple a bit with my blender --- I did not include the rings whole. This helped me spread it through the cake mixture a lot more evenly, but I don't think it was absolutely necessary.

**Regarding cost**: I already had everything I needed, so in the context of our food challenge, I used "$0." If you were to buy all these, I still think you could make this cake for under $5. The agave nectar is the most expensive part. Most places I looked are selling bottles like the one I have for a minimum of $5 by itself. You can avoid this expense by substituting sugar (dissolving it in the juice before distributing it), substituting honey (though I'm not sure how much this would affect the flavor/texture since it's thicker), or by using canned fruit suspended in syrup. Most canned fruit can be found for between $0.50 and $2.00. A box of yellow cake mix can run from about $0.75 to $2.50. Butter I saw ran about $2 a pound, or $0.50 per stick. Especially if you specifically budget the ingredients, you can make this cake very affordably.
