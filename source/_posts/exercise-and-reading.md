I walked around the park with my friend and his dog for about an hour today.  It was in the upper 70s, but not too bad.  I do have leash burn on the back of my leg, though.  The dog got way too excited and ran around me, so ouch. I've finished several books lately:  the first _Dresden Files_ book, the first _Mysterious Benedict Society_ book, the second and third _Percy Jackson_ books, and _Sunken Treasure_.  Out of the group, I enjoyed _The Mysterious Benedict Society_ the most.  I'll definitely pick up the second one at some point, and hopefully I'll continue to enjoy the series through the 3rd that I have from iTunes.  The _Percy Jackson_ books are definitely better to read in print than to listen to on audio.  Definitely much quicker to read.  I now understand why _The Lightning Thief_ was such a short audiobook.  It looks like all the Percy Jackson books are under 200 pages so far.
