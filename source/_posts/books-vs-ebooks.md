I have been interested in electronic books since the [Bookman](http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Bookman) came out when I was a kid.  The idea of carrying around a library in my pocket is incredibly exciting.  I've been most interested in ebooks for their size and mobility.  I never ended up getting a Bookman due to cost, and availability of books (for the most part the only books I knew you could get were various versions of the Bible and dictionaries). For a long time, I forgot about ereaders completely.  I got wrapped up in school, and did a lot less reading for pleasure.  As school-related reading began to subside, and as e-ink technology became more viable, my interest in ereaders flickered to life again. While I was interested in e-ink ereaders, I had (and have) an unfounded skepticism with regard to Amazon's Kindle.  I think part of it has to do with it feeling like such a closed platform, but otherwise, I'm not sure.  When I began looking at alternatives, I mostly came up with non-US products such as the iRiver Story (which did become available in the US early this year). My roommate at the time, Jason, got a Sony reader.  He likes it because it has expandable memory, can read many different formats, and is relatively affordable.  His reader does not have 3G or wi-fi access, so he has to use his computer any time he wants to put new books on his reader.  For myself, I eventually settled on the Nook.  To me, it seemed like a good compromise between openness, and easy access to a large bookstore.  So far, I have been very pleased with my Nook. Since I've gotten a Nook, I've struggled a lot more with whether to read print books or ebooks.   I still sometimes run into the problem I had with the Bookman where books I want just aren't available as ebooks (especially if I want a book as soon as it's released).  Because I've always preferred paperback books to hardcover, finding a paperback version of the book I want (new or used) is often cheaper than buying the ebook version (I know publishers have been complaining about ebooks being under-priced, but they must only be considering hardcover prices because I can find many new paperback novels for $6-8 msrp, so a $9.99 ebook is definitely more expensive). Looking at the differences in how they can be ultilized as resources, on readers vs. on a computer, and between genres, Stephen at [Stephen's Lighthouse](http://stephenslighthouse.com/) examines [the difference between (print) books and ebooks](http://stephenslighthouse.com/2010/05/10/books-and-ebooks-as-different-as-night-and-day/ ) in a different light.  I thought some of you guys might be interested in reading what he has to say, especially in reference to nonfiction and textbooks.  With every type of e-resource jumbled into one big category in many of today's media stories, it's nice to see a demarcation and examination of the growing world of electronic works.
