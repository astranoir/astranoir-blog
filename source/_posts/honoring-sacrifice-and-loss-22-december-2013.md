As an advocate for peace, I choose to take the time at least once weekly to remember the cost of war to civilians, and to remember the friends and families of United States service personnel who have died.   Since I last posted, the Department of Defense announced the following service personnel deaths: Marine Corps Lance Cpl. **Matthew R. Rodriguez**, 19, of Fairhaven, Massachusetts Navy Petty Officer 1st Class **James L. Smith**, 38, of Huffman, Texas

Army Chief Warrant Officer 2 **Randy L. Billings**, 34, of Heavener, Oklahoma

Army Chief Warrant Officer 2 **Joshua B. Silverman**, 35, of Scottsdale, Arizona

Army Sgt. **Peter C. Bohler**, 29, of Willow Spring, North Carolina

Army Sgt. 1st Class **Omar W. Forde**, 28, of Marietta, Georgia

Army Staff Sgt. **Jesse L. Williams**, 30, of Elkhart, Indiana

Army Spc. **Terry K. D. Gordon**, 22, of Shubuta, Mississippi

McGouldrick Jr**. of New Haven, Connecticut It is also easy to forget that the human cost of war extends beyond combat-related deaths. _May the friends and families of those who have died find peace. May those in combat areas, as well as their friends and families, find peace. May returned veterans find peace. _May those who experience the mental health costs of war find peace. _May the world find peace._
