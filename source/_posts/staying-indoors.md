It turns out it _is_ snowing...  It rained all night and morning, and recently began sleeting and snowing.  With all the wet, my ceiling is leaking again, even after the roof was replaced.  Now it's in my living room instead of just my kitchen, though. Yuck, what a gross weekend outside.  Fortunately, I have _Hikaru no Go_ and _Dr. Who_ to watch.  (I'm watching the first season of _Dr. Who_ that has David Tennant as the Doctor.) I read a bit more _Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell_.  I'm at the beginning of Book 2 now.  It finally feels like the book itself is beginning.  I'm not sure why it feels like such a slow read.
