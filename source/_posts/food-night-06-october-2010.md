I hosted food night at my house this evening.  Turnout was a bit sparse, but we knew that it would be ahead of time, so we just decided to make hand foods/finger foods.  As always, everything was delicious.  We ate pretty quickly, so I have some pictures of my food that I took previously, and then a couple quick shots that I took after-the-fact. I decided to try making savory scones.  I had never made scones of any type before, but [this recipe](http://danatreat.com/2010/09/savory-scones/) really caught my eye, so I tried it out.  I didn't use fresh dill because I couldn't find any (I used some dried dill weed), but I otherwise stuck pretty close to the recipe.
