Rain, indeed, today.  The sky opened up right as I was leaving work.  It's a bit cooler in my upstairs apartment now, which is nice. I finished _Torchwood_ (season 4) this afternoon.  I was dissatisfied with this season.  I'm not sure if I was dissatisfied because I didn't like what happened, or if I didn't like the way it was written.  Maybe I was most disappointed in the characters. Should I post more creative writing?
