Now that Lent is over, I am considering what (if anything) will change about how I interact with my blog.  Most likely, the only thing that will change is the frequency of my posts.  I will still attempt to post daily, but I will not stress as much about making that goal.  I would like to also do more creative writing, but I am not sure I will be up for it, creatively speaking.
