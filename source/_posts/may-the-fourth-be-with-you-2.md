Happy Star Wars Day! Kes and I went walking (plus a tiny amount of jogging) around Wilson Park today.  It was fun, but I find that my leg muscles seem much stronger than my heart/lungs (or that's what it feels like).  Looks like I need to do a lot more cardio! **Plant update:** These pictures are a bit blurry.  I had problems getting the camera to focus on the plants.  (Click to enlarge the pictures.)
