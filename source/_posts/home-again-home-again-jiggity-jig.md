Whew.  That was a much busier weekend than I normally have.  I'm trying in general to do more with my day, though.  After work I met up with Kes, and we went shopping for a new book for him, and groceries for me.  He picked up[Cryptonomicon](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/816.Cryptonomicon), while I picked up some deli meat and cheese, as well as the ingredients for chicken tetrazinni.  To be honest, cooking this has been a lot more work than I expected.  I always forget how long it takes for liquid to thicken while cooking it on the stove. I am not sure what I want to be reading right now.  I'm currently rereading[American Gods](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4407.American_Gods), and have recently finished [Rendezvous with Rama](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112537.Rendezvous_with_Rama). I am not sure if I want to read more science fiction, like [Gateway](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/218427.Gateway), or if I want to go more a fantasy route.  I would like to reread [A Game of Thrones](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13496.A_Game_of_Thrones) so I can discuss it with Kes, but I don't want to continue largely rereading books rather than broadening my library. Tomorrow, I think Kes and I are going to go ice skating at the Jones Center.  Hopefully I'll remember to take my camera and take some pictures.  I'm still terrified of falling on the ice.
