The weather is nice out today (about 55F), so I walked to Harps to pick up 2lb of strawberries for food day at work tomorrow.  I'm trying to be more active, so it was nice to get outside and have a brisk walk.  Enjoying the sun was also nice.  I probably fill my "nerd" stereotype a bit too much regarding never seeing the sun. I'm about halfway through chapter 2 of [Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/259035.Jonathan_Strange_Mr_Norrell_A_Novel).While I haven't gotten far in the book, I am enjoying it immensely.  One thing I find particularly amusing are the footnotes.  In general I find footnotes to be both amusing and enjoyable in fiction.  At the moment the main one other than [Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/259035.Jonathan_Strange_Mr_Norrell_A_Novel) that comes to mind is [Good Omens](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/474059.Good_Omens), but I'm pretty sure I've enjoyed footnotes in other books as well. My plans for this evening include picking up some dinner for myself and a friend, then chilling at his house while watching [Top Gear](http://www.topgear.com/uk/).  As little as I know about cars, I find both [Top Gear](http://www.topgear.com/uk/) and [Car Talk](http://cartalk.com/) incredibly enjoyable.  Maybe I secretly have a passion for cars, but I just won't tell myself. Today my dad pointed me toward an Engadget article about an [$85 netbook](http://www.engadget.com/2010/03/03/coby-85-smartbook-feels-like-a-hundred-bucks-hands-on/). It's certainly limited (tiny screen, non-Atom processor, etc.), but at $85, I don't see any reason not to at least check it out.  It seems like it would be great for a student, or anyone who needs to take notes on a regular basis.  Regarding application capabilities and such, it seems more like a mobile phone than a laptop.  To be fair, though, mobile phones can do quite a bit these days. Ĝis! (until next time)
