I'm still devouring Dr. Who.  David Tennant is amazing.  I can't believe he's wanted to be the Doctor since he was 3.  Imagining that kind of dedication, to a goal, to his craft, is beyond me.  I admire him greatly (and am a bit celebrity infatuated). Speaking of celebrity infatuation (I guess I've been having that a lot more lately), Kes and I are watching _Repo Men_ tomorrow.  I've heard mixed things about it, but I would like to see what more Jude Law can do.  I'm pretty sure the only things I've seen him in are _Sherlock Holmes_ and _Gattaca_, and I'd like to see more. I'm slightly disappointed there was no chance of me being at PAX East this year.  I missed out on Wil Wheaton's keynote (possibly more celebrity infatuation; geekiness is great and attractive, even if you're "_just_" a geek), which I'm sure was amazing.  I also missed out on a chance to see wonderful friends.  I hope the experience is marvelous for everyone.  This past fall, I loved PAX, and I'm sure PAX East will be fantastic.
