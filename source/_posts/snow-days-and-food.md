More snow. It seems I'm always talking about snow on this blog. Bizarrely, though the picture below looks a bit dark, it was blinding outside when I took it. [![](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5132/5418629433_dedde97742.jpg "snowy street")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bubem/5418629433/) Apparently I cook a lot when I'm snowbound in my home. I made some brownie mini cupcakes.

(While I like baking sweets, I tend to burn out on eating them really quickly. Feel free to take advantage of this by getting me to bake things, than taking all the leftovers.)

[![](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5297/5418551013_4466d1ebb7.jpg "lunch")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bubem/5418551013/) I came to the realization last night that my road was a little scarier than other people's roads when I invited Maggie, Marisa and Brandon over for a Doctor Who night, and they informed me of this fact. Alas! I'm really excited because we finished the new season 1, and watched David Tennant's first Christmas special. I really hope everyone enjoys David Tennant as the 10th Doctor.
