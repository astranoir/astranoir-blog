I've been slowly attempting to make my house look nicer. Toward that end, I've bought posters (only framing and hanging a couple of them so far, though), and most recently I've bought new dishes. They're brown and blue glazed stoneware, plus some brown tinted glasses. I partially bought them so my house/dishes would be more coordinated, but I've also found that when I host things like food night, I don't actually have enough dishes to serve everyone. Now I should have enough, and they'll all match! Here's all my dishes after I ran them through the dishwasher for the first time: [![](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5093/5443745395_a401374c83.jpg "new clean dishes")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bubem/5443745395/) Monday, I had a dinner video date with [Ryan](http://suavepeanut.com). We had red curry, and I got to use my new dishes, as well as the complimenting table cloth and placemats: [![](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5134/5449319249_466c227491.jpg "Valentine's Dinner")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bubem/5449319249/) I've been bringing cereal to work for breakfast lately. The main hurdle I've had to overcome is the logistics of bringing milk to work. So far, the best solution I've found is to reuse Starbucks coffee bottles. Major perk: the glass bottles of milk make me feel like I have fresh, hand-delivered milk, even though that's far from the truth.
