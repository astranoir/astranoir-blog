As an advocate for peace, I choose to take the time at least once weekly to remember the cost of war to civilians, and to remember the friends and families of United States service personnel who have been killed.   This past week, the Department of Defense announced the following service personnel deaths: Spc. **Angel L. Lopez**, 27, of Parma, Ohio Lance Cpl. **Jeremiah M. Collins, Jr.**, 19, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin 1st Lt. **Jennifer M. Moreno**, 25, of San Diego, California Sgt. **Patrick C. Hawkins**, 25, of Carlisle, Pennsylvania Sgt. **Joseph M. Peters**, 24, of Springfield, Missouri Pfc. **Cody J. Patterson**, 24, of Philomath, Oregon

This past week, the Department of Defense identified and accounted for the following service personnel: Army Air Force 1st Lt. **Robert G. Fenstermacher**, 23, of Scranton, Pennsylvania U.S. Marine Corps Capt. **Henry S. White**, 23, of Kansas City, Missouri U.S. Marine Corps Staff Sgt. **Thomas L. Meek**, 19, of Lisbon, Louisiana U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. **Robert E. Pietsch**, 31, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania U.S. Air Force Maj. **Louis F. Guillermin**, 25, of West Chester, Pennsylvania

It is also easy to forget that the human cost of war extends beyond combat-related deaths. [On October 11th, the Department of Defense has resumed providing families with death benefits](http://www.defense.gov//releases/release.aspx?releaseid=16311) (a practice that had [temporarily halted due to the partial government shutdown](http://www.defense.gov//releases/release.aspx?releaseid=16303)). _May the friends and families of those who have died find peace. May those in combat areas, as well as their friends and families, find peace. May returned veterans find peace. _May those who experience the mental health costs of war find peace. _May the world find peace._
