I had a lot of fun this weekend.  Friday, Garth and I went to The Smoke & Barrel to see the OneUps and MC Frontalot.  This is the first time I saw the OneUps do any hiphop type stuff (versus more jazzy renditions of video game songs).  What impressed me most about MC Frontalot was the energy in everyone's performance.  They were almost constantly jumping around while they were playing and singing.  It was both impressive and engaging. Saturday Kes, Jason and I went to the Walton Arts Center to see Steve Martin's concert.  Since it was banjo-oriented we weren't sure if he would be super serious, but he worked in some bits between songs that were quite funny.  Even though we were in the back row of the balcony, we could still see really well, which impressed me.  Previously, Kes and I have mostly just been to radio plays at the WAC, and so have sat near the front of the floor. Sunday, I relaxed a little.  I put together the desk I bought, and set it up as my entertainment center.  It works really well, and the shelves look nice.  I like the height, but it is about a foot taller than what I was using previously, so it will take some getting used to.  If nothing else, everything around the television looks a lot more neat and organized. Today, Kes and I made sushi.  Kes has made sushi once before (and I helped roll) when we had a "sushi party" a couple years ago.  (It was fun; we ate sushi and watched _The Twilight Zone_.)  This was the first time I really made any of the ingredients (sushi rice, mostly).

I thought it turned out pretty well.  The fillings we used were egg (with a little soy sauce), imitation crab, avocado, and carrot matchsticks.
