Maggie made delicious crepes for dinner, and I was fortunate enough to be invited over!  Homemade crepes filled with asparagus and creamy, cheesy spinach.  She also made sweet crepes that we filled with various things for dessert (such as apple butter, nutella, jam, etc.). ![](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1305/5177537068_32c12bf245.jpg "nom nom crepes")
