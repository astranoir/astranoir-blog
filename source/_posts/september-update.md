[![](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3153/2987099837_3c05b348e2_m.jpg "By DeusXFlorida via Flickr")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/8363028@N08/2987099837/) I actually got home at a reasonable hour tonight!  I've definitely been much more social than I'm used to lately; it's surprising that today felt like a "light" day.  After work I grabbed some groceries and gas, then headed home and unwound while watching [Law & Order: Los Angeles](http://www.hulu.com/law-and-order-los-angeles) (who knew this existed? Not me).  I then made and devoured stuffed squash blossoms (filled with goat cheese, parsley and roasted garlic - delicious!) with Maggie and Marisa.  Back home to do mundane things like wash dishes and shower. I've been listening to more music lately.  A bit of listening to [the college station](http://kxua.uark.edu/), and a lot of listening to my iPod.  This evening I've just been moving my iHome around the house with me as I do evening activities. It's kind of nice not living near campus/Dickson while Bikes, Blues and BBQ is gearing up.  There have been a few more motorcycles in my part of town, but not in any bothersome way. Tomorrow I'm headed to the [Apple Festival](http://www.arkansasapplefestival.org/) with a few friends.  I'm not sure what will be there other than apples and hand-crafted items, but wandering around festivals with friends is enjoyable (and slightly alliterative). **(Warning, short ramble below.)** I completely rewrote a poem I first completed (and published in the _Muse_, probably) in high school.  You can [click here to read it](http://astranoir.com/?page_id=358) if you wish.  Um, but I'm definitely self-conscious about it, so just a heads-up. :-/  Additionally, saying it's a poem may be misleading because when I hear it in my head, it's a song.  I just haven't been able to transcribe it.  Anyway, me posting it is partially me trying _not_ to be so self-conscious about things, so we'll see how that turns out.  Theoretically, the more I show people things I've created, the less it will be unusual and/or stressful.
